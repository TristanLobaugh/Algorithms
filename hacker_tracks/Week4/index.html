//EXERCISE
//Write a program that, given an age in seconds, calculates how old someone is in terms of a given planet's solar years.


//DETAILS
// Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

// Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
// Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
// Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
// Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
// Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
// Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
// Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
// Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

// So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31 Earth-years old.


//Place code below:
var planets = [];
var earthYearInSecs = 31557600;
var inputAgeInSecs = prompt("Enter age in secs with no commas", 1000000000);

function Planet(name, orbitalPeriod){
   this.planet = name;
   this.earthYears = orbitalPeriod;
   this.calcAge = function(ageInSecs){
      var planetYearInSecs = earthYearInSecs * this.earthYears;
      var age = ageInSecs / planetYearInSecs;
      if(age > 1){
        age = Math.floor(age);
      }
      else{
         age = +age.toFixed(2);
      }
      alert("You are " + age + " " + this.planet + "-years old!");
      }
}

planets.push(new Planet("Earth", 1));
planets.push(new Planet("Mercury", 0.2408467));
planets.push(new Planet("Venus", 0.61519726));
planets.push(new Planet("Mars", 1.8808158));
planets.push(new Planet("Jupiter", 11.862615));
planets.push(new Planet("Saturn", 29.447498));
planets.push(new Planet("Uranus", 84.016846));
planets.push(new Planet("Neptune", 164.79132));

for(var i = 0; i < planets.length; i++){
   planets[i].calcAge(inputAgeInSecs);
}
