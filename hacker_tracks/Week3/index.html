//a) Write a function that would return an array of all the odd numbers between 1 to 50. (ex. [1,3,5, .... , 47,49]). Hint: Use 'push' method.

	function oddNumbers() {
   		//Place your code here 
   		var arr = [];
   		for(var i = 1; i <= 50; i++)	{
   			if(i%2 !== 0)	{
   				arr.push(i);
   			}
   		}
   		return arr; 
	}


//b) Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that squares each value in the array. When the program is done x should have values that have been squared (e.g. [1, 25, 100, 4]). You're not to use any of the pre-built function in Javascript. You could for example square the value by saying x[i] = x[i] * x[i];.

	function squareVal(arr) {
   		//Place your code here 
   		var sqarr =[];
   		for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)	{
   			sqarr[i] = arr[i] * arr[i];
   		}
   		return sqarr; 
	}

console.log(oddNumbers());
console.log(squareVal([1,5, 10, -2]));
